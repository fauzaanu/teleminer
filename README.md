# Teleminer

Pyrogram bot to mine telegram data from groups and keep them stored within multiple folders.


## The plan

# Monitoring

Each folder is an individual telegram account.

Each account will have the following:
Avatars - Folder
Username_logs - File (append)
Bio_logs - File (append)
Phone_number_logs - File (append)
Name_logs - File (append)

# Alerting

We will flag users who change their username, bio, phone number, or name. This will easily reveal people who are using telegram for other purposes.


# Monitoring Locations

Monitor all groups, channels, and private chats.
We could also create bait telegram channels to attract people to join and eventually monitor them.
